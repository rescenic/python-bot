markdown-helper: |
  Markdown is a very powerful formatting tool supported by telegram. {} has some enhancements, to make sure that saved messages are correctly parsed, and to allow you to create buttons.\n
  <b>Supported Markdown:</b>
  - <code>__italic__</code>: Double underscores will produce <i>italic</i> text.
  - <code>**bold**</code>: Double asterisks will produce <b>bold</b> text
  - <code>`code`</code>: Backticks will produce <code>monospace</code> text.
  - <code>~~strike~~</code>: Double tildes will produce <del>strikethrough</del> text
  - <code>--underline--</code> Double Hyphen will produce <u>underline</u> text
  - <code>[sometext](someURL)</code>: this will create a link - the message will just show sometext, and tapping on it will open the page at someURL.
  EG: <code>[test](example.com)</code>
  - <code>[buttontext](buttonurl:someURL)</code>: This is the formatting to create a telegram button. buttontext will be what is displayed on the button, and someurl will be the url to redirect.
  EG: <code>[This is a button](buttonurl:google.com)</code>

  If you want multiple buttons on the same line, use :same, as such:
  <code>[one](buttonurl://example.com)</code>
  <code>[two](buttonurl://google.com:same)</code>
  This will create two buttons on a single line, instead of one button per line.

  Keep in mind that your message <b>MUST</b> contain some text other than just a button!
